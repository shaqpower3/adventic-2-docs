# Window type selection

Upon first booting the game, you are presented with a split-screen between a text-only window and a GUI-based window (TODO).

When hover the cursor over one of the sides, that side will expand slightly to preview more of that side.

Clicking the side when it's exanded will lock in your decision, fully expanding that side to fill your screen. You will be able to change this decision in the settings. (TODO)

## Text mode

In text mode, you can use the arrow keys and enter to navigate the menus. Upon first selecting Text mode, you will be presented with the [game selection menu](gsm_text) which can be navigated using the up and down arrows, and a game can be selected using the enter key.
