# Game selection menu (text mode)

The GSM shows a list of all the games that have been currently downloaded, inwhich the details of a game will be limited to one line, the rest will be truncated with ellipsis. 

Once a game is selected, the user will be brought to a menu displaying full information about the game (TODO currently only name) and options to return to the menu, edit the game or run the game.



## Game Editor

Selecting "Edit" from the game options menu opens the game editor, from which you can edit the title (TODO), description (TODO) and script of the game. For the syntax of the script, see [game script](/script)
